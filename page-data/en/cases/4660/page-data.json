As he mainly eats and rests on his vehicle and has not used the rest stations and other communal failities at the Terminals, it is uncertain whether the virus was transmitted through community or the Terminals. On account of being a resident at Tsz Wan Shan, he undertook a virus test in late July arranged by  Home Affairs Department and tested negative. He tested positive on August 21 upon resubmission of sample. He has no travel history and exhibited no symptoms.","classification":"local_close_contact","classification_zh":"本地個案的密切接觸者","classification_en":"Close contact of local case","source_url_1":"https://hk.feature.appledaily.com/wars/article/EMIP2QDVLRCWHO5U2GB4E56QDQ","source_url_2":"https://news.mingpao.com/ins/%e6%b8%af%e8%81%9e/article/20200823/s00001/1598170550688/%e6%96%b0%e5%86%a0%e8%82%ba%e7%82%8e-%e4%bb%8a%e5%a2%9e25%e5%ae%97%e7%a2%ba%e8%a8%ba-19%e5%b1%ac%e6%9c%ac%e5%9c%b0%e6%84%9f%e6%9f%93-%e8%b2%a8%e6%ab%83%e7%a2%bc%e9%a0%ad%e5%a2%9e%e4%b8%8072%e6%ad%b2%e5%8f%b8%e6%a9%9f%e6%9f%93%e7%96%ab%e5%b1%85%e6%85%88%e9%9b%b2%e5%b1%b1","groups":[{"case_no":4660,"name_zh":"葵涌貨櫃碼頭","name_en":"Kwai Chung Container Terminals","description_zh":"患者包括貨櫃車司機及碼頭職員，在不同的碼頭工作，當中多名患者屬「宏記港務操作有限公司」，該公司的休息室會有逾百人共用，員工會在內吃飯、洗澡、用廁所及睡覺，似家居傳播環境。部份員工或要登上貨櫃船上工作，有機會接觸海員。首名發病患者曾參與稻香慶回歸活動，衞生防護中心表示不排除有多個感染源頭。","description_en":"The patients - including cargo truck drivers and porters - work at different container terminals, but it is likely that the virus transmission have taken place at shared rest stations. Numerous patients are employed by Wang Kee Port Operation Services Limited who use a communal rest station shared by over a hundred employees, where they dine, bathe, and use the toilets, altogether resembling a domestic transmission environment. Some employees may work on the cargo ships and thus possibly have contacts with sailors. The first patient who developed symptoms took part in the 'Hong Kong Handover celebration event' at Tao Heung. CHP stated the possibility that there are more than one source of transmission.","id":52,"related_cases":"2189, 2987, 3313, 3742, 3764, 3977, 4003, 4037, 4090, 4105, 4181, 4183, 4192, 4203, 4215, 4221, 4238, 4272, 4293, 4313, 4333, 4336, 4343, 4352, 4353, 4365, 4380, 4381, 4386, 4409, 4410, 4414, 4415, 4416, 4417, 4418, 4420, 4421, 4428, 4429, 4436, 4440, 4442, 4443, 4444, 4445, 4446, 4450, 4451, 4452, 4453, 4454, 4455, 4456, 4457, 4458, 4459, 4460, 4462, 4463, 4470, 4480, 4504, 4517, 4528, 4570, 4576, 4577, 4588, 4589, 4590, 4638, 4640, 4660, 4667, 4734, 4747"}]},"patientGroup":[{"fieldValue":"4660","edges":[{"node":{"case_no":"4660","start_date":"","end_date":"2020-08-23","sub_district_zh":"慈雲山","sub_district_en":"Tsz Wan Shan","location_zh":"慈樂邨樂仁樓","location_en":"Lok Yan House, Tsz Lok Estate","action_zh":"住宿","action_en":"Accommodation","remarks_zh":"","remarks_en":"","source_url_1":"https://gia.info.gov.hk/general/202008/23/P2020082300520_348111_1_1598184395549.pdf","source_url_2":""}}]}],"locale":"en"}}}
