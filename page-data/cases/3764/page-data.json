Numerous patients are employed by Wang Kee Port Operation Services Limited who use a communal rest station shared by over a hundred employees, where they dine, bathe, and use the toilets, altogether resembling a domestic transmission environment. Some employees may work on the cargo ships and thus possibly have contacts with sailors. The first patient who developed symptoms took part in the 'Hong Kong Handover celebration event' at Tao Heung. CHP stated the possibility that there are more than one source of transmission.","id":86,"related_cases":"2189, 2987, 3313, 3742, 3764, 3977, 4003, 4037, 4090, 4105, 4181, 4183, 4192, 4203, 4215, 4221, 4238, 4272, 4293, 4313, 4333, 4336, 4343, 4352, 4353, 4365, 4380, 4381, 4386, 4409, 4410, 4414, 4415, 4416, 4417, 4418, 4420, 4421, 4428, 4429, 4436, 4440, 4442, 4443, 4444, 4445, 4446, 4450, 4451, 4452, 4453, 4454, 4455, 4456, 4457, 4458, 4459, 4460, 4462, 4463, 4470, 4480, 4504, 4517, 4528, 4570, 4576, 4577, 4588, 4589, 4590, 4638, 4640"}]},"patientGroup":[],"locale":"zh"}}}
